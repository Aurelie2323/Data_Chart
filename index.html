	<h1>Staten Island Home to the County With the Highest COVID-19 Mortality Rate</h1>
	<h3>By Aurelie Muntzel</h3>

	<p class="pink">It’s been nearly two years since the first recorded COVID-19 case, and within those two years came major advancements in the testing and tracing system in the United States. Particularly in New York State; home to the most densely populated city in the county. New York State (NYS) has poured well more than $30 million into the NYS contact tracing Initiative, a program which trains and dispatches individuals to monitor the spread of COVID-19 by contacting and monitoring those infected. 
	</p>

	<p class="pink">
	State and Federal initiatives have led to one of the fastest testing-and-tracing programs, with publicly available programs updated everyday. These day-to-day updates have provided a large swath of information of the virus’ spread, helping provide a clear picture of the toll that the pandemic has had for the State. Staten Island has outpaced other counties in its COVID-19 death toll, with 587 deaths in Richmond County up to date.

	"It comes down to vaccination rate," says infection disease specialist Dr. Michael Rosenberg. Dr. Rosenberg noted that though the Omicron variant has led to more breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated people are still more vulnerable across the board.x	</p>
